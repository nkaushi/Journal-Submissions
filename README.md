# Journal-Submissions
This is the unpublished work submitted to IEEE journals during my research. The work primarily includes research on the Power Side Channel (PSCA) Detection Circuit and Secure Analog-to-Digital Conversion. The directory includes results from the test chip, enhanced detection accuracy using data-driven noise analysis (DDNR). It also contains a fully differential switch capacitor circuit derivation to sense both sides. All the work mentioned here was accomplished with my advisor, Dr. John Hu, at Oklahoma State University from 2020 to 2025. 

Thank You,
Dr. Kaushik
